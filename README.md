# Problem_solving_by_AI
When mathematics, problems solving, annotations meets AI . Finally I am trilled to share this project where I have spent couple of hours on this problem in order to extract the final outcome. This problem will be useful for everyone especially students who tends to search the solution of numerical problem either by typing or uploading images which sometimes fail to generate due to lack of additional resourses. Here I have even used gemini for generating the solutions. It can solve maths, physics ,chemistry and various kinds of problems also. 
here is a basic symbols I have added to for running the model
index fingure=sketching
index+middle fingure= no sketching
index+middle+last fingure=sending question to gemini.
